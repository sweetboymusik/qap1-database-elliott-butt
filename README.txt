QAP 1 -  Database
Elliott Butt

1. This took me about 3-3.5 hours to complete.
2. The PostgresTutorial website, Stack overflow, general google searches.
3. I did not ask any friends for help in solving the problems.
4. I did not ask for extra help from any instructors.
5. Difficulty ratings:
    problem 1: simple and straight-forward!
    problem 2: simple for most aspects,
               JOIN statements a little harder to wrap one's head around, 
               bonus a little harder trying to find a query that was meaningful with all constraints
    problem 3: simple and straight-forward!
    problem 4: simple in difficulty, but more work than the others
               setting up foreign key constraints a little more involved
